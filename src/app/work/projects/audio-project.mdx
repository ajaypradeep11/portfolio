## Overview

**Guess the Beat** is an interactive audio game developed in **C++ with FMOD and OpenGL**, designed to test the player’s rhythm recognition skills.  

The game features **three levels**, each introducing unique challenges and audio cues. Players must correctly identify beats within limited attempts to progress through the levels. A combination of **streaming sounds, sampled sounds, DSP effects, and external file loading** make this project both technically rich and gameplay engaging.  

The game runs in **Debug X64 mode** and provides a flexible audio system that allows for replacing sound files without recompilation.

## Gameplay

- The game consists of **Level 1, 2, and 3**.  
- Each level gives the player **three attempts**. Failing results in **Game Over**.  
- A **beat is played with Q**, and the player must guess it correctly from given options using **R + number keys (1–4)**.  
- Successfully completing all three levels results in a win.  

## User Manual

- To change audio without recompiling, replace files in:  
  `SOLUTION_DIR\common\assets\audio\`  
- **Streaming Sounds (3)**: Background music (start, in-game, game over).  
- **Sampled Sounds (8)**:  
  - Level 1: 4 sound options  
  - Win/Lose sounds  
  - Level 2: Left, Right, Center  
  - Click sound for option selection  
- **Pause/Play**: Background music can be toggled with `TAB`.  
- **Attribute Control (5)**: Volume, Pan, Reverb, Lowpass, and Pitch effects applied dynamically.  
- **External File Loading**:  
  - `audioGameWonOrLose.txt` → Win/Lose audio  
  - `audioAutomatedSound.txt` → Automated audio  
  - `audioQuestionLevel1.txt` → Level 1 options  
  - `audioQuestionLevel2and3.txt` → Level 2 & 3 options  
  - `audioBGM.txt` → Background music  

## Controls

- **Enter** → Start the game  
- **Q** → Replay the given beat  
- **R** → Replay beat options  
- **1, 2, 3, 4** → Select beat option  
- **Tab** → Pause/Play background music  
- **ESC** → Quit game  
- **7, 8, 9, 0** → Toggle audio effects for current channel  

### DSP Effect Toggles

- **Z (BGM channel)** → Echo, Flange, Object Pan, Highpass  
- **X (Voice channel)** → Distortion, Tremolo, Oscillator, Normalize  
- **C (Options channel)** → Chorus, Pan, Fader, Limiter  
- **V (Song channel)** → Delay, Convolution Reverb, Lowpass, Compressor  

## Key Features

- **Three Levels** with progressively challenging rhythm guessing.  
- **Three Streaming BGM Tracks** for intro, in-game, and game over.  
- **Eight Sampled Sounds** for options and feedback.  
- **DSP Audio Effects** across multiple channels (BGM, Voice, Options, Song).  
- **External File-Based Configuration** for dynamic audio updates.  
- **Pause/Resume Audio** functionality.  
- **Debug X64 Build** for final submission.  

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core implementation.  
- **FMOD**: Audio system for streaming, sampling, DSP, and attributes.  
- **OpenGL**: Rendering support for visuals.  
- **GLFW & GLAD**: Input handling and OpenGL function loading.  
- **File I/O**: External audio configuration system.
