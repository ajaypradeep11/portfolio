## Overview

This project focuses on building a **multi-carrier shipping management platform** that helps businesses and customers access affordable and efficient delivery services. By integrating with multiple carriers, the system enables users to compare shipping rates, choose the most cost-effective option, and streamline logistics.  

The frontend was designed in **Figma** and implemented using **ReactJS with CoreUI** for a clean and responsive user experience. The backend was built using **NestJS**, providing a scalable API layer for rate calculations, order processing, and integration with local carriers.  

Initial integrations include shipping providers such as **Sendle, Trexity, FastTurn Express, and Loomis**, with plans to expand to more providers. The system is being actively developed as an ongoing project, especially due to recent **disruptions in the US and Canadian shipping industry** that have highlighted the importance of flexible, multi-carrier logistics solutions.  

## Key Features

- **Rate Comparison**: Users can compare live shipping rates across multiple carriers and select the most cost-effective option.  
- **Multi-Carrier Integration**: Initial setup includes Sendle, Trexity, FastTurn Express, and Loomis, with more providers to be added.  
- **Order Management**: Streamlined process to book shipments, track orders, and manage delivery statuses.  
- **Customer-Centric Pricing**: Local carrier integrations provide better rates tailored to customer needs.  
- **Responsive UI**: Built with CoreUI for React to ensure a clean and easy-to-use interface.  

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: For wireframes and UI/UX design.  
- **ReactJS (CoreUI)**: For the frontend, delivering a modern and responsive design.  
- **NestJS**: Backend framework providing APIs, business logic, and carrier integrations.  
- **Local Carrier APIs**: Direct integrations with Sendle, Trexity, FastTurn Express, and Loomis.  

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was integrating different shipping carriers, each with unique APIs and pricing models. Standardizing the data flow for rate comparison and ensuring real-time updates required custom logic and testing.  

Another challenge has been the **volatile shipping environment in North America**, where frequent disruptions affect delivery times and pricing. Designing a system resilient to such changes required a flexible backend and modular carrier integrations.  

From a frontend perspective, balancing complexity with usability was key—ensuring customers could easily compare rates without being overwhelmed by too much data.  

## Outcome

Although still in progress, the **Multi-Carrier Shipping System** has laid the foundation for a robust logistics solution. Businesses can now access more affordable rates and flexibility in choosing carriers, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.  

The project demonstrates how a combination of **ReactJS, NestJS, and strategic carrier integrations** can create a platform that addresses current shipping challenges and scales with future needs.
