## Overview

This project was developed as part of a **Final Project in Networking**, where the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game is implemented with interactive controls and 3D-like gameplay.  

The game allows players to compete by placing **X** and **O** using custom mechanics (firing symbols instead of traditional clicks), while also supporting constraints and input handling for more dynamic interaction.  

The entire project was compiled and executed in **Release X64 mode** for performance and stability.

## Gameplay

- The objective is the same as classic **Tic Tac Toe**: align three **X** or **O** in a row to win.  
- Instead of simple clicks, players use a **weapon-like shooting system** to place their symbols.  
- The game features **pan controls**, constraints, and a more interactive board environment.  

## Controls

- **Mouse** → Pan the game board  
- **Space** → Fire weapon (place an X or O)  
- **Tab** → Show constraints (applied at the top-left corner, i.e., X at (0,0))  

## Key Features

- **Networking Component**: Designed with networking capabilities to allow multiplayer functionality.  
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Placement of X and O through a shooting mechanic.  
- **Constraint System**: Ability to show and manage constraints (demonstrated at position (0,0)).  
- **Custom Controls**: Combination of keyboard and mouse input for a unique play experience.  
- **Optimized Build**: Runs in Release X64 mode for smooth execution.  

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core language for game logic and networking.  
- **Networking APIs**: For handling communication and multiplayer aspects.  
- **Custom Engine Features**: Board management, input handling, and constraints.
