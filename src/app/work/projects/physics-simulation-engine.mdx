## Overview

This project was developed as part of a **Physics Midterm**, implementing a small-scale physics engine in C++. The focus was on **particle-based simulations**, where particles are subject to forces, collisions, and constraints in a dynamic environment.  

The engine supports multiple physics interactions, such as particle collisions, projectiles, and force applications. It was designed with an **object-oriented approach**, making it modular and extendable for additional physical phenomena.  

## Key Features

- **Particle System**: Representation of particles with position, velocity, acceleration, and mass.  
- **Collision Handling**: Detection and resolution of contacts between particles, planes, and other constraints.  
- **Force Generators**: Implementation of gravity, drag, and custom force generators.  
- **World Simulation**: Management of particles, forces, and interactions in a unified physics world.  
- **Projectiles & Fireworks**: Demonstration of applied physics with projectile motion and particle explosions.  

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core language for logic and simulation.  
- **GLFW**: Window creation and input handling.  
- **GLAD**: OpenGL function loader.  
- **OpenGL**: Rendering framework for real-time visualization.  
- **OOP Design**: Modular code with extensible components (e.g., Particle, ForceGenerator, Renderer).
