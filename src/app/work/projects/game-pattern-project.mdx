## Overview

This project was developed as part of a **Final Exam**, exploring both **with and without design pattern implementations** in a simple 2D space shooter game. The application runs in **Release X64 mode** for smooth performance and demonstrates structured game management principles.  

Two versions of the project were created to show the difference in design structure and maintainability:

- **WithPatternFiles** → Implements a **Game Manager** that organizes rendering, enemy ship spawning, and movement logic.  
- **WithoutPatternFiles** → Contains raw implementation of all game entities (Player, Enemy, Shield, UFO, Missile) without centralized management.  

## Gameplay

- Control a spaceship, dodge enemy ships, and fire missiles to destroy them.  
- Enemies move with **progressively faster speeds**, creating increasing difficulty.  
- Missiles are created programmatically (via custom-defined functions).  

## Controls

- **A / D** → Move the ship left and right  
- **Space** → Fire missile  

## Key Features

- **Pattern-Based Design**: Game Manager organizes entities and game flow in the "With Pattern" version.  
- **Direct Implementation**: "Without Pattern" version shows raw handling of all game objects.  
- **Enemy Management**: Enemy ships rendered and animated with movement logic.  
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Ships transition from slow to fast movement over time.  
- **Custom Missile System**: Missiles implemented manually (even prototyped in Notepad functions).  
- **Release X64 Build**: Optimized for performance in final exam submission.  

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core programming language.  
- **OpenGL**: Real-time graphics rendering.  
- **GLFW**: Handles input and window creation.  
- **GLAD**: OpenGL function loader.  
- **Design Patterns**: Game Manager implementation for maintainability and scalability.
